See the deployed app here: https://danielgerrald.github.io/Lunch-Randomizer/

Our team was randomly chosen and we were given tasked to create an app that incorporated 2 API's that we have never used before. We also want to expand our knowledge of other CSS frameworks so we decided to use Materialize for the CSS. The app has a polished UI and is interactive as well. 

The random lunch generator was created out of necessity since our team has a hard time picking where to eat lunch everyday. Our app will allow a user to enter inputs like type of cuisine and a search radius. Once the inputs are chosen we will randomly generate a restaurant within the input radius entered. The restaurants selected from the radius input is based on the userâ€™s current latitude and longitude. Once the API returns the 10 results of the restaurant it highlights each item in the list until it finally stops on the selected restaurant. The selected restaurant is displayed below with their name as a link to the Zomato URL of the place, an image of the restaurant, their hours of operation, and their average rating from 0-5. We also display a Google map of the location of the restaurant.

We wanted the user to have his other 9 options available as well so those results reside on the page in a list but can be clicked to take the user to the Zomato url of the restaurant.

Our team had a lot of fun creating this project and we hope you use it for your future culinary needs. If you encounter any issues with the app please don't hesitate to reach out to the team.
