        <span class="white-text">Our team decided to create a random restaurant selector for our first project. We
          wanted to solve a
          problem which all of us have encountered in our lives. Where to eat lunch or dinner? When you've worked or
          lived in an area for an extended
          period of time, you've probably eaten at a majority of places within your comfort radius. When you just can't
          decide or want some
          inspiration, we got you covered. Just type in a cuisine and the distance you are willing to travel and
          <strong>VOILA</strong> your future meal awaits!
